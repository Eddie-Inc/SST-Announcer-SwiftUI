# SST-Announcer-SwiftUI

Email Draft to Prinicpal:

Dear Mr Chan,
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Ayaan Jain, and I am the Chief Admin Officer of SST Inc. I am writing to request a meeting with you to present a revised version of the SST Announcer application that I, together with a few other ExCo members have been developing. We would like to showcase our new rendition of the app to you.
SST Announcer is an app built for students and staff of the School of Science and Technology, Singapore, to stay updated with the schoolâ€™s announcements with ease and convenience on their devices. The app allows users to browse, pin and share important announcements made by the school. Furthermore, the app also sends notifications to students whenever a new announcement is posted. This helps to ensure that students are kept updated with the latest information from the school. It also allows them to sign up for competitions and programs efficiently. 
We have created a new rendition that greatly improves and optimises SST Announcer. With 200% faster loading speeds and much better optimisation, users can use the app more effectively with tools such as pin posts, custom categories, cache posts, and much more. We have had extensive user testing of the app to ensure that all these features work well and effectively.
We believe that our app can greatly benefit the school community, and we are excited to share it with you. We would like to request a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to present our revised version of the app and receive your feedback. We hope that you will find our app to be a useful addition to the school's communication tools.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and we look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,
Ayaan Jain,
CAO of SST Inc.
